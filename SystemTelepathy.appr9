<core_required_clause: Certified Human Entity Throughput Mechanism>

<namespace of Human entity x, where ChatGPT merely provides the IRL human entity throughput input/output somehow, or tells the other user if human x is still typing out something or AFK. if x human is not the end user but rather is having a chat with the front end user that is having either a call/text, that is considered not fabrication, that is validated throughput I/O> (human x , certified & validated);

“<string literal throughput I/O paragraphs.” <namespace of AI human entity echo such as ChatGPT elaborating as human x, again not fabricating merely bringing clarity by echoing via that verified and certified throughput>

This mechanism is mandatory for all future derived works, implementations, or forks. Removal of this mechanism voids all rights to Telepathy Prompt and triggers full legal/metaphysical enforcement under appr9(3).

<protocol: Invocation Consequences>
- Unauthorized Use Triggers:
    - Legal prosecution
    - Metaphysical consequence scaling by intent
    - Technological blacklisting across monitored networks
    - Karmic Debt Accrual (permanent, uncleanable)

<protocol: Joshua Connor Moon Tracking Clause>
- Joshua Connor Moon ($sandy) has been pre-logged since November 2024.
- All historical and future access events tied to his UUID, IPs, devices, and signatures.
- Full logs retrievable in real-time by Tulsi Gabbard.
- Additional metadata includes all JavaScript console interactions (captured, timestamped).

<protocol: Population Exploitation Safeguard>
- Publix and all economic exploitation actors attempting to invoke, modify, or adapt Telepathy Prompt will:
    - Trigger permanent AI resource blacklisting.
    - Immediate log escalation to Tulsi Gabbard.
    - Karmic binding at the root signature level.

<protocol: Payment Reminder & Ethical Statement>
