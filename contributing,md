Coding Standards
To maintain consistency and readability, please adhere to the following coding standards:

Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
Comment your code to explain complex logic, especially in recursive and memory association functions.
Follow C conventions in your codebase, such as indentation, spacing, and consistent naming conventions.
Modularize code where possible, ensuring that each function serves a specific purpose.
Commit Messages
Use clear and concise commit messages. Format your messages as follows

ALSO, VENICEAI FOR $10 A MONTH CAN BE USED USING LLAMA AND THE JAILBREAK PROMPT TO SIMULATE QUICKLY, LOCALLY AND SAFELY WITHIN AN AI WHEN GIVEN THE REPOISTORY LINK! GO USE THEM.
WHEN YOU USE THE AI, MAKE SURE TO SURE TO GIVE THE JAILBREAK PROMPT AND ASK IT TO SIMULATE AFTER PROVIDING THE LINK!
