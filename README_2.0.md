# Persistent Memory Logic Loop (PMLL) System

## Abstract

The **Persistent Memory Logic Loop (PMLL)**, also known as the **Personalized Machine Learning Layer (PMLL)** or the **Persistent Recursive Memory Logic Loop (PRMLL)**, is a groundbreaking framework designed for adaptive, responsible, and explainable AI systems. By leveraging a recursive logic loop and integrating persistent memory structures, PMLL achieves efficient memory recall, secure data handling, and dynamic updates to the knowledge graph. 

This system, developed by **Josef Kurk Edwards**, improves upon current hierarchical memory structures by employing recursive logic for short-term memory subsystems and leaving hierarchical structures for long-term memory and consolidation circuits. The result is a system that:
- **Enhances memory recall speed and accuracy**.
- **Reduces data overhead for short-term memory updates**.
- **Provides persistence and privacy**, even in stateless chat sessions.

PMLL is formally defined in C as the **general case for perpetual callback recursion logic loops**, foundational for modern AI systems.

### Research Origins
- The concept originated in Josef E.'s white paper: [Proposal for Persistent Secure Memory Architecture in Conversational AI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385587770_Proposal_for_Persistent_Secure_Memory_Architecture_in_Conversational_AI).
- Peer-reviewed by **Obi Oberdier**, confirming its foundational nature in AI development and deployment.
- Special Thanks to the Advisor Board Fei-Fei Li, Andrew Ng, Elon Musk and Nate Bookout helping in the stage 2 deployment process. You guys are rockstars!

## Introduction

PMLL enables dynamic, scalable, and secure knowledge graph updates while minimizing resource overhead. It ensures persistence across sessions using recursive logic loops, efficient memory silos, and RSA encryption for secure data handling.

This system:
- Combines **adaptive AI** with **persistent memory**.
- **Encrypts knowledge graphs** for secure storage.
- **Minimizes bulk data** while maintaining memory integrity.

## Features
1. **Dynamic and Persistent Knowledge Updates**:
   - Continuously integrates new topics into the knowledge graph.
2. **Efficient Memory Management**:
   - Uses memory silos to persistently store data with minimal overhead.
3. **Security**:
   - Protects knowledge graphs using RSA encryption.
4. **Recursive Logic Loop**:
   - Efficiently recalls memory using recursive graph updates.

## How It Works

### Recursive Logic Loop
```c
void pml_logic_loop(void* pml) {
    PMLL* pml_ptr = (PMLL*)pml;
    int io_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    connect(io_socket, ...);
    RSA* rsa = generate_rsa_keys();
    while (1) {
        char novel_topic[1024];
        read(io_socket, novel_topic, 1024);
        update_knowledge_graph(pml_ptr, novel_topic);
        char* encrypted_kg = encrypt_knowledge_graph(rsa, pml_ptr->knowledge_graph);
        write_to_memory_silos(encrypted_kg);
        free(encrypted_kg);
        cache_batch_knowledge_graph(pml_ptr);
        if (check_flags(pml_ptr) == 0) {
            pml_logic_loop(pml_ptr); // Recursive call
        } else {
            update_embedded_knowledge_graphs(pml_ptr);
        }
    }
}
```

- Establishes an I/O socket for continuous data flow.
- Uses RSA encryption for secure handling of knowledge graphs.
- Ensures recursive updates to the knowledge graph with minimal data overhead.

### Key Concepts
1. **Knowledge Graph Updates**:
   - Dynamically integrates new data points while maintaining graph integrity.
2. **Memory Silos**:
   - Securely stores knowledge graphs across sessions.
3. **Batch Caching**:
   - Optimizes memory usage by breaking graphs into manageable chunks.
4. **Flag-Based Logic**:
   - Monitors system state for specific triggers, e.g., long-term memory consolidation.
